# 📚 Singly Linked List Library (Java)

A simple and reusable **Singly Linked List implementation in Java**, built as a learning-focused library.  
This project provides a custom `LinkedList` and `Node` class to understand internal working of linked lists without using Java’s built-in collections.

---

## ✨ Features
- Custom implementation of a **Singly Linked List**
- Node-based structure (`Node` class)
- Supports basic linked list operations
- Clean and readable code
- Designed as a **library**, not a runnable application

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Java (Core Java)**
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Custom data structure implementation

---

## 📌 Usage
This project is intended to be **used as a library**.

You can import and use it in another Java project:

import mySinglyLinkedList.LinkedList;


Create and manipulate the linked list using the exposed methods.
